            Welcome to the introduction to Hibiscus Family.
        </h3>
        <p>Hibiscus is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is quite large, containing several hundred species that are native to warm-temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are often noted for their showy flowers. The tea made from Hibiscus flowers is known by many names in many countries around the world and is served both hot and cold. The beverage is well known for its color, tanginess, and flavor. It is known as bissap in West Africa, karkad√© in Egypt and Sudan, flor de Jamaica in Mexico, gudhal in India, and gongura in Brazil. Some refer to it as roselle, a common name for the Hibiscus flower.

            There are many folk remedies attributed to Hibiscus flowers, including antihypertensives, antiatherosclerotics, antioxidants, antihypercholesterolaemics, antinociceptives, antipyretics, antimutagenics, antifungals, antibacterials, and chemopreventives. These properties are attributed mainly to their polyphenolic constituents; thus, the Hibiscus species needs to be investigated in more detail.
